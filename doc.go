Package naneat offers an extensive implementation of NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies).

Godoc

Doc is under constructions...

Notes:
 - Currently most of struct members are public - fields are no reason exported - in this package. Use them at your own risk. (Though, we'd better to use methods to access fields in most cases than to expose them directly.)
 - The nil slices are disallowed in any struct. Constructors may initialize them to empty slices.
 - It is strongly recommended to use constructors (func New~) to create any struct instance rather than just having it with composite literals.
